 * Submitting an abstract: register first, then submit.
 *
 * Two gates, in order, and both are real rather than decorative. requireUser()
 * bounces a signed-out visitor to login.html carrying `?next=submit.html`, so
 * they come back here instead of landing on a generic account page with no clue
 * what they came for. Then the address has to be confirmed, because
 * firestore.rules requires `email_verified` on an abstract write — showing the
 * form to somebody who would only collect a PERMISSION_DENIED at the end of it
 * would waste the one thing they came to do.
 *
 * The token is refreshed before that second check: clicking the verification
 * link does NOT update the token a tab already holds, and a stale token is what
 * used to make a first submission fail and then "fix itself" an hour later.
