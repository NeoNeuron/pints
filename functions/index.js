// Work the browser cannot do: admin-only destructive operations, the
// participant backfill, and the contact-form mailer.
//
// Everything else on this site is a static page talking straight to Firestore,
// with firestore.rules as the only authorization boundary. Deletion cannot work
// that way, for two reasons:
//
//  1. A Firebase Auth account can only be deleted by its owner from a browser.
//     Removing somebody else's login needs the Admin SDK.
//  2. storage.rules keys figure deletion to the uploader's uid and cannot read
//     Firestore, so there is no isAdmin() to appeal to. Rather than bake a list
//     of admin uids into the rules, figure deletion happens here, where the
//     Admin SDK ignores rules entirely.
//
// The participant backfill is here for the same reason: it writes on behalf of
// somebody who is signed in nowhere, which only the Admin SDK can do.
//
// The test for whether something belongs in this file is narrow — does it need
// to bypass the rules, or hold a secret the browser must not? Ordinary reads and
// writes belong in firestore.rules, or the site stops being a static site.
//
// mailContactMessage is here on the second justification: SMTP credentials.
// A static page cannot hold a password that sends mail as the organizers.
//
// NOT here, for now: syncDropboxGallery, the archive photo sync. It is the one
// function that needs the second justification — a Dropbox token — and it
// cannot deploy until DROPBOX_APP_KEY, DROPBOX_APP_SECRET and
// DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN exist in Secret Manager. An undeployable function fails
// the whole `firebase deploy --only functions`, so it was taken out to let the
// rest ship. Restore it with `git revert` of the commit that removed it, once
// the secrets are set; the browser half is untouched and still waiting for it.
//
// THE SAME TRAP APPLIES TO mailContactMessage. It binds CONTACT_SMTP_USER and
// CONTACT_SMTP_PASSWORD, so deploying this file before those two secrets exist
// fails the whole deploy and takes the deletes and the backfill down with it.
// Set them first — see "Contacting the organizers" in the README. The contact
// page itself does not care: it writes to Firestore, which works whether or not
// anything here is deployed, and only the mail waits on this.
//
// Because the Admin SDK ignores rules, EVERY function below must check the
// caller itself. A callable's request.auth is set by the platform from a
// verified ID token and is trustworthy; nothing the client says about itself is.

 * by its owner or an organizer, and the person in question is signed in
 * nowhere. The Admin SDK ignores rules, which is what makes this function the
